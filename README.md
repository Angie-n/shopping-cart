## Reflection


To practice React Routing, I developed a fake shop page for a plant business. Users are able to add various products to the cart, which are reflected in their count and charge. 


A challenge I faced in the app was routing, and deciding which React router to use. I initially started with BrowserRouting since it is recommended and used in most React applications. However, I noticed that attempting to share the url of a particular page would not show the product as intended. Since sharing product pages are important for shop pages, I switched to HashRouters, which gave me the functionality I needed.
